Virtual Study buddy is an application to help you find people to study with during the strange times of the pandemic. 
To effectively use the application one should sign in with their google account and create a user profile. After creating
an account you will be directed to your account page. At the top of the screen there will be five tabs available for you 
to use. The first tab is titled find buddies. This tab will allow you to scroll through or search for other users profiles 
and send them a message. This message is ideally to create a study group. The next tab displayed is titled my groups. This 
is where you will find all of the study groups that you are currently in. One thing to note is that once you join a group
it will be removed from all groups and only be found in my groups on your account. From the My groups tab you can go to your
group page where you can see a group message and a meet group button. Selecting the meet group button will allow you to enter
a time and date to meet and the website will generate a google meeting link for everyone to use. The next tab that you'll see
is the all groups tab. This Is where you will be able to join any groups that may interest you. You can also use this tab to 
create a new group if you don't see one that fits. The next tab is the Inbox. This is where you can send messages to any user you
want or view messages that you may have already sent from the Find Buddies tab. When sending a message it is important to remember 
the person's username as you need to know it before you send the message. Lastly is the view profile tab. This tab allows you to see
your profile and edit it to make any changes that you may want to make.
